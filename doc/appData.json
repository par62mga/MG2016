There are a lot of good genes in its pool -that of MG96, MG2001, MG2006, and MG2011. Each of these events developed their own personality and you can expect nothing less from MG2016!<p>You will want to arrive on Monday in order to attend our cocktail reception at Churchill Downs Derby Museum and Racing Facility. Running from 6pm-10pm, the reception will have a cash bar (we advise eating dinner before or after your visit as there will be no food available during the event). You will have time to peruse the exhibits in the museum as well as take a guided tour of the grounds. This is a not-to-miss event. Spaces are limited, so register early!<p>Our daily activities begin on Tuesday with driving tours, motorcoach tours, tech sessions, and Register Night. We'll cap off the evening with a performance by the band Captain Rat and the Blind Rivets at the Crowne Plaza.<p>Wednesday will offer more opportunities for you to learn about your MG during our tech sessions; you can travel the fantastic roads of Indiana and Kentucky by taking one of the self-guided tours; hit downtown Louisville and visit the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory; visit the Muhammed Ali Center; take in an early afternoon baseball game at the home of the Louisville Bats, a farm league team for the Cincinnati Reds. Plan on attending our auction at the Crowne Plaza on Wednesday evening!<p>Thursday is show day! We will have our MGs on display at Waterfront Park on the banks of the Ohio River in downtown Louisville. Each Register will have their respective models displayed by class for popular voting by attendees. (NAMGBR will also hold Concours.) Our awards ceremonies and banquet will be held at the Crowne Plaza on Thursday evening. Awards other than First Place (and other special awards) will be given out by Register prior to the banquet as we did at MG2011.<p>We are pleased to announce that DENNIS GAGE of &quot;My Classic Car&quot; will be our guest on Thursday at Waterfront Park. He will be wandering the showfield and will be available for &quot;photo&quot and autographs. Dennis will also be our keynote speaker at the Awards Banquet that evening at the Crowne Plaza. After the awards banquet, head out to the parking lot(s)to kick a few more tires and swap a few more lies before you head for home on Friday!<p>MG2016 - Be there to help us &quot;Maintain the Breed&quot;!<p>Be sure to register early as some activities have limited spaces available."
